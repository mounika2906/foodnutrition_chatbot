It has also been widely disseminated through \\noutreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of \\nlectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages. \\nIn the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in \\nIndia.

There have also been some important \\ngovernment initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation, \\nincluding the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION \\nNutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper \\ndiet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development \\nand to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and \\ndistribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The \\nrecommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and  technical in \\nnature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components \\n(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since \\npeople consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather \\nthan nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to \\nthe food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines \\nare a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. \\nThey represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets \\nthat should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of \\nnutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old \\nage. \\nFormulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing \\nrequired guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary \\nguidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological \\nor high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and \\nhealth personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the \\ngoals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. \\nThe dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the \\nprevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the \\nsocial,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines \\ncan be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to \\nreach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. \\nThe major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of \\nfoods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in \\nIndia are low  birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non- \\ncommunicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of \", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\mouni\\\\Desktop\\\\projects\\\\diet_guidelines_chatbot\\\\data\\\\DietaryGuidelinesforNINwebsite.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='malnutrition (under  and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences \\nindicate that undernutrition in utero  may set the pace for diet-related  chronic \\ndiseases in later life. Population explosion, demographic changes, rapid \\nurbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of \\ncertain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related \\nchronic diseases. \\nThe dietary guidelines emphasize promotion of health and prevention of \\ndisease, of all age groups with special focus on vulnerable segments of the \\npopulation such as infants, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating \\nwomen and the elderly. Other related factors, which need consideration are \\nphysical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development, \\nall of which strongly influence nutrition and health. \\nIn this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative \\nterms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which \\ncan maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with \\ntraditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as \\npulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy \\ndecisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted. \\nA variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common \\nman, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only \\nfour accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations \\nand culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from \\na variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The \\ncooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.  The proposed guidelines help to \\nformulate health promoting recipes and diets which are region- and culture- \\nspecific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of India. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.  \\nTranslation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several \\ngovernment and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed, \\nherein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance \\nof optimal health. Effective IEC strategies and other large-scale educational \\ncampaigns should be launched to encourage people to follow the dietary \\nguidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition \\nand health programs. nutrition \\n2', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\mouni\\\\Desktop\\\\projects\\\\diet_guidelines_chatbot\\\\data\\\\DietaryGuidelinesforNINwebsite.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO \\n     Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human \\nresource development in the country.  India has been classified by the World Bank \\n1as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It \\nth ranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian \\npopulation, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be \\n2below the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an \\naverage, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban \\nareas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable \\nchronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced \\nphysical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines \\ndevelopment. \\n     Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A \\ndeficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) \\nand vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently \\nencountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities. \\n     Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive \\nmaternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, \\nnutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with \\n3low birth-weight (<2500 g) , as compared to less than 10% in the developed \\ncountries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even \\nduring early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of \\nsevere PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, \\nnational surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub- \\nclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which \\n3indicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there \\nis a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% \\n4at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty \\ninfant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. \\nPersistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to \\nshort stature in adults.  About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body \\n2Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter) ] below 18.5, which indicates \\n4Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- \\n1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness.  \\nVitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death.

       " Document(page_content='3Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)  are \\nanemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence \\n5of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women . It is \\n6estimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%  of maternal deaths \\nevery year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight.  It adversely affects \\nwork output among adults and learning ability in children. \\nIodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of \\npopulation in several parts of the country.  About 167 million are estimated to be \\nliving in IDD endemic areas.  Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid \\ngland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental \\nretardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular \\ndisorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is \\ncretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from \\nthe birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to \\nmaternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, \\n72.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps . \\nIndia is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem \\nof undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is \\nemerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of \\noverweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in \\n4 8 rural areas . The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus  and Coronary Heart Disease \\n9(CHD)  is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The \\nincidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to \\n10 men (113 for 100,000) . \\nThe overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a \\nsignificant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million \\n11,12 tones during 2007-2008 . Though the production of cereals and millets appears to \\nbe adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually \\nshows a decline.  Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand \\n13 of 100 million tones . The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 \\nmillion tones,  corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than \\n14 the world average of 285 g per day . Though the per capita availability of various \\nfoods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the \\ncommunity and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low \\nincome and purchasing power.

Linoleic (n-6) and -linolenic (n-3) acids are the \\nsimple PUFA, which are present only in plant foods (Table 6). All vegetable oils \\n(except coconut) are good sources of linoleic(n-6) acid.

These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.  \\nWashing \\nThe first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is \\nwashing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing. \\nWashing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that \\nnormally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.  \\nThe pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, \\nplums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require \\n2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The \\npesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal \\nprocessing such as washing, blanching and cooking. \\nBlanching \\nBlanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the \\nvegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.  \\nBut before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and \\nfruits.  \\nPeeling \\nContact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be \\nremoved by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from \\nthe raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net influence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed \\nfood.
